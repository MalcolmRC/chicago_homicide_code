# Predoc Code Samples

This repository contains the data and R files for a code sample prepared by Malcolm Robinson Campbell. 

There are two R files:

1. A R file that leveraged City of Chicago data to explore the joint spatial distributions between homicides and several demographic indicators.
2. A R file containing a text analysis of articles describing violence and security in Colombia.

The contents of the repository are part of an application for a predoctoral research position at the Harris School of Public Policy.
